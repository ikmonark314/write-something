# write-something
If you want to write any common statement at the the top of all the ".py" files in a particular directory. Then just run write_something.py
But remember that this script should be in main directory that is one level up.
Just change the ############# to the line you want to implement on the files on line number 13 of the script. 
Like if you want to write common import statement to all files. etc.

Open in terminal where your this script resides and give the command 
python write_something.py
